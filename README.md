# Secure_Messenger
Making Instant Messaging Secured by Using Multiple Channels


This app allows users to input a message and share the encrypted message through one of the installed social messengers on the device and the key from another one. In addition, users can decrypt the message that they received. The security design in this study is a combination of One-time pad algorithm for encryption plus Secret sharing scheme for key management and distribution. This method allows users to share the encrypted message from one channel, such as an available instant messenger on the market and share the key from another channel.

The one-time pad is an encryption method that is unbreakable both in theory with considering unlimited processing power and in reality. However, key management and distribution in this algorithm is an issue that has made it unreachable. The idea of splitting the ciphertext and the key removes the key management barrier such as running out of key in this algorithm which allows us to send data, for instance, a simple message securely over an insecure network like the internet.
